- Hello, Folks! ðŸ‘‹
- My name is Shaurya Negi and I'm a data analyst/machine learning engineer. I'm from India, living in New Delhi and currently working at IBM.
  I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Scikit Learn, as well as work in TensorFlow. I also enjoy databases, ui, ux, and cryptocurrencies in general.
